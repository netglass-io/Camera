    # CRITICAL: NVIDIA GPU runtime for Jetson devices
    # This MUST be set to "nvidia" to enable GPU acceleration on Jetson
    # Without this, CUDA/TensorRT will not work, and GPU-based CV models will fail
    # Reference: riva-speech container on agx1 uses runtime: nvidia
    # See: docker inspect riva-speech | grep Runtime
    # Official docs: https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/tutorials/jetson-container
